MultiWii_EZ_GUI_Pad
===================

This is based on https://github.com/eziosoft/MultiWii_EZ_GUI (v90-3.44), and I add some features for China Area.

(1) Add 10 inches Pad UI layout. You can switch UI mode between Phone mode and Pad mode.
<br>
(2) Add AUX/Tuning/Arm/DisArm operation in control UI, for easy to control your multicopter.
<br>
(3) Enable Map as OSM map, not Google Map, and I will add baidu map as the default map. In addition, for those phone without Google GMS install,
    You can install Google Map using this App (need your phone rooted).
<br>
(4) Add TTS voice speaking for Chinese language by using eSpeak lib.

<br>

Please see screen shot in wiki (https://github.com/sufferpriest/MultiWii_EZ_GUI_Pad/wiki)

Please pay attention that don't use function "control your copter" for your large copter or low speed bluetooth.
